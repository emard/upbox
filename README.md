# Changes

Changed mount legs positions to be placed near panel.
Mounting screw positions look to me more "symmetric",
but that's perhaps only a question of taste.

From given PCB size it calculates size of box enclosure and
lets mounting feet be centered.

Parametric distance from feet center to wall/panel.

Parametric clearance from mounting legs to inner shell wall
and between top/bottom halfs.

Parametric all sizes of the screw holes.
